# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to DSH Vision Toolkit are documented in this file. The project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and uses semantic version tags.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Merged upstream `v0.1.40`: shared-storage root (`storageDir`) feature with a plugin-owned `storage-domain` sidecar so persisted pasted-image and artifact paths survive read-only Settings changes and Profile restarts; runtime health checks now cover the credential, artifact directory, and temporary directory; the local multi-provider Settings UI is kept (the upstream single-provider credential field assertion is dropped).
- Expanded the remote provider failure taxonomy with machine-routable error categories: `auth`, `quota`, `rate_limit`, `server`, `network`, `region`, `tos`, and `invalid_request`, each classified from the provider output (401/403 → auth, 402 → quota, 429 → rate_limit, 5xx → server, connection failures → network, region/ToS/HTTP 400–422 → their own categories).

### Fixed

- Fixed being unable to enter a conversation under DSH `v0.1.2-alpha.4`: that version replaced the `Session.events` getter with `snapshotEvents()` (session-log-read-intent), and iterating the removed getter threw `session.events is not iterable`, which took down `agent/created` → session restore. The durable event log is now read via `snapshotEvents()` with a fallback to the legacy `events` getter, so both runtime lines restore correctly.
- The failover loop now retries only transient failures in place (`timeout`, `server`, `network`) and fails over immediately on deterministic ones (auth, quota, rate_limit, `invalid_request`, region, tos) instead of re-requesting a backend that cannot succeed with the same input.
- Fast failures now advance to the next provider: previously the hedge timer only launched a successor when the current provider was slow (crossed `t1`), so a quick auth/5xx/network failure could stall failover; a new advance step launches the next provider unless superseded, cancelled, or the remaining budget is too small.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Hedge-based failover across the enabled vision providers: when a single request crosses a provider's `t1Seconds` threshold it keeps running while the next provider starts in parallel, and a provider whose cumulative request time reaches `t2Seconds` is terminated; the result always prefers the highest-priority provider.
- Rate-limited (HTTP 429) providers are parked and revisited at a 10-second cadence once every other provider is exhausted, instead of being treated as a terminal failure.
- New `vision_concurrency` tool that reports live concurrency: per-session available/max/in-use/free slots plus a per-model free-slot breakdown.
- New timeout & concurrency settings that replace `timeoutMs`: per-provider `t1Seconds`/`t2Seconds` and global `hardTimeoutSeconds`, `sessionMaxConcurrency`, and `minAvailableSeconds`. The per-session gate now rejects excess concurrent calls immediately instead of queueing.

### Changed

- Renamed the per-call override on every vision tool from `timeoutMs` (milliseconds) to `timeoutSeconds` (seconds, 1–600) and updated tool descriptions with the session concurrency note.
- Added a new `rate_limit` error category for HTTP 429 responses.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Synced upstream updates and fixed a startup compatibility issue under DSH `0.1.2-alpha`: the `settingsNamespace` export was removed from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings` in that version, and importing a missing named export is a module-evaluation error that stops the host from booting. The settings namespace check is now inlined (a static string validated against the namespace pattern) instead of importing the removed helper, so the plugin loads on both `0.1.0-rc.6` and `0.1.2-alpha`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Added `prepareCall` to the image-input variant adapter so the variant route works with any installed `dsh-llm` version (newer host contracts call it before dispatch).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Reported the alpha (transparency) channel of locally analyzed images in every image-info block.
- Online vision service supports multiple provider APIs: enable/disable, per-API resource and concurrency limits, a per-API attempt count, and user-sortable priority. A failed or concurrency-exhausted request fails over to the next provider until all are exhausted, and images that exceed every provider's limits are compressed once before the request.

## [0.1.40] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- Stopped importing the `settingsNamespace` export from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings`, which dsh 0.1.2-alpha removed; the plugin now inlines the namespace check, so the profile no longer fails to boot on the alpha channel.
- Retained configured shared-storage roots in a plugin-owned `storage-domain` sidecar, so persisted pasted-image and artifact paths remain readable after read-only Settings changes and Profile restarts.

## [0.1.39] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Retried transient Windows `EBUSY`/`EPERM`/`EACCES` failures when deleting or replacing managed and bundled-Python runtime directories, so antivirus real-time scans no longer make first-run environment preparation report "运行环境尚未就绪".
- Kept the primary runtime preparation error visible when best-effort cleanup also fails: staging, quarantine, bundled-Python staging, and lock cleanup now log a warning instead of masking the real failure.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Inherited each upstream provider's configured retry policy on its Vision Toolkit image-input variant route.
- Published this customized package under `@mengruo/dsh-vision-toolkit`.

## [0.1.38] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- Persisted the final model-visible image evidence across DSH Profile restarts, so historical images no longer consume vision quota again or change the main model's cached conversation prefix.
- Preserved both successful descriptions and `[vision unavailable: ...]` results byte-for-byte; only requests that fail before producing any model-visible result are retried.
- Bound persisted evidence to the Session lifecycle, attachment, focus prompt, credential, and output-affecting runtime settings to prevent replay across incompatible configurations.

## [0.1.37] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Added a bilingual, screenshot-based AIHubMix guide covering signup through the Inferera entry, API key creation, free Gemini 3.7 Flash model selection, exact Vision Toolkit settings, and troubleshooting.

### Changed

- Replaced the Groq tutorial link in Vision Settings with the AIHubMix guide and select the matching English or Chinese page from the configured vision-output language.
- Updated the English and Chinese READMEs to use the Inferera signup entry and feature the AIHubMix guide.

## [0.1.36] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- The bundled standalone Python now downloads from the domestic mirror (Tencent Cloud COS, `dsh-vision-python-bootstrap-1317715800.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com`) first and falls back to the GitHub release when the mirror is unreachable, so users in China no longer need GitHub connectivity for the first-run Python bootstrap. The pinned `assets/python-bootstrap.json` gained an optional `mirrorBaseUrl`, and all eight platform archives are hosted on the mirror. The locked runtime dependencies (Pillow, NumPy, vtracer) are installed from the Tencent Cloud PyPI mirror (`mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple`) first and fall back to the official PyPI index.

## [0.1.35] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- Made the fast restore mode trigger more sensitive: a floating "快速还原为 HTML" / "快速生成" / "quick restore" control visible in the reference image now counts as a speed signal.

## [0.1.34] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- **Transparent variant routing is now on by default**: `imageInputVariants.hidden` defaults to `true`, so image-input variant routes keep the original provider and model display names and the model selector shows one entry per model out of the box. Users who prefer the explicit `(Vision Toolkit)` entries can disable the “透明变体路由” setting (advanced settings → image input) to restore the previous behavior.

## [0.1.33] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Transparent variant routing** (`imageInputVariants.hidden`, off by default): image-input variant routes keep the original provider/model display names, and the browser hides the upstream text-only twins so the model selector shows one entry per model. Pasted images, image history, and the built-in `read_image` tool keep working on text-only models; opening the selector no longer flashes a duplicate group because hiding is synchronous DOM reconciliation. Disabling the setting restores the explicit `(Vision Toolkit)` entries.
- Settings UI: “透明变体路由” checkbox under advanced settings → image input, with bilingual copy.

### Changed

- Lowered the built-in free vision service daily quota to 100 requests.

### Fixed

- Toggling transparent routing is display-only: it no longer rebuilds or re-verifies the vision runtime.
- The browser display-config cache is invalidated on Settings saves, and an in-flight response can no longer repopulate it with a stale flag.
- Restoring upstream model entries after transparent routing is disabled, and guarding the selector integrator against duplicate installs.

## [0.1.32] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- Fixed the compressed-image cache silently missing on Windows when cache file paths exceeded the 260-character `MAX_PATH` limit; cache keys now use shorter 64-bit digests and are versioned as `v2`, so old oversized entries are pruned automatically.
- Made the portable package verification and the test suite Windows-compatible, including `npm.cmd` invocation, path-separator handling, Python bootstrap fixture layout, a profile E2E prompt that avoids newline-carrying argv, and restart-helper test skips where automatic restart is intentionally unavailable.
- Routed Windows `pnpm` batch shims through `cmd.exe` so plugin updates work when the harness resolves `pnpm` to a `pnpm.CMD` path.
- Added a Windows CI job that runs the portable-package build, tests, and verification on `windows-latest`.
- Fixed an intermittent `NO_ADAPTER` failure on image-input variant routes (`vision-toolkit-<provider>`) after adapter re-registration, model switches, or hot reload: wrappers now survive transient registry gaps, are re-registered when the live registry drops them, and self-heal on a periodic sweep.

## [0.1.31] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Renamed the bundled Skill from `vision-tools` to `vision-skills`, so the model-facing name describes the capability instead of the underlying tools. Sessions created before the rename still restore activation from legacy `vision-tools` history; new sessions invoke `/vision-skills`.

## [0.1.30] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- Raised the default vision operation timeout from 15 seconds to 30 seconds for both semaphore queueing and tool execution.
- Removed the practical global ceiling on the built-in free vision service (raised from 5,000 to 1,000,000,000 requests per UTC day) while keeping the per-client daily and burst quotas.

## [0.1.29] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **Install and use with zero Python setup.** When no system Python 3.11+ is available, the plugin downloads a pinned, sha256-verified standalone Python 3.13 build (about 35 MB) on first use and prepares its isolated runtime with it, so new users no longer need to install Python first. A system Python or an explicit `runtime.python` override still takes precedence, and a committed manifest plus `scripts/python-bootstrap.mjs` keeps the pinned build auditable and updatable.

### Fixed

- Keep the `vision_toolkit_activate` bootstrap callable until the end of the model step when the Skill and the bootstrap are invoked in parallel, preventing a race that surfaced as `unknown tool "vision_toolkit_activate"` while the Skill call was already activating the visual tools.
- Reword the `vision-tools` Skill description so screenshot-to-UI restoration reliably triggers visual-tool activation.

## [0.1.28] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- Treat HTTP 403 from `GET /models` as a warning instead of claiming the API key was rejected, because providers such as Groq can restrict the model-list endpoint while real multimodal requests still work. Settings now notes that this warning can be ignored when the real vision-model test reports success.

## [0.1.27] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Automatically compress input images above `maxImageBytes` (4 MiB default) or `maxImagePixels`, preferring lossless PNG/WebP/GIF re-encodes before lossy quality reduction and, as a last resort, downscaling.
- Accept pasted images up to 20 MiB and compress them on first tool use instead of rejecting anything above `maxImageBytes`.
- Persist compressed copies in a versioned, hash-verified workspace cache so repeated calls reuse the same compressed image.
- Keep original display names on crop/trace/long-OCR/foreground/pixel-diff outputs and preserve EXIF/ICC metadata when re-encoding.

### Fixed

- Reject tampered or symlinked compressed-cache entries and prune stale or oversized cache files.
- Mark JPEG q95 as lossy and try true lossless PNG/WebP re-encodes first for every source format.

## [0.1.26] - 2026-08-17

### Docs

- Documented how and when to configure the Python 3.11+ `runtime.python` override with system interpreters, project-local virtual environments, and the Windows `py` launcher.
- Added reproducible `uv` setup, managed-versus-external dependency guidance, Profile health/model checks, and a `vision_glance` smoke-test workflow.
- Clarified automatic platform temporary-directory authorization, Windows `/tmp/...` mapping, extra `allowedDirs` roots, and ignored project-local `.venv/` directories.

## [0.1.25] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- Added the documented `VISION_SSL_VERIFY` escape hatch for trusted self-signed or MITM-proxied vision endpoints, forwarded it through the isolated DSH runtime, and kept TLS certificate verification enabled by default.
- Allowed `vision_toolkit_activate` to mount the visual tool schemas even when the model invokes the bootstrap before loading the `vision-tools` Skill, removing the activation deadlock while preserving Agent-scoped exposure.
- Authorized the platform temporary directory for visual inputs and mapped model-generated `/tmp/...` paths to `%TEMP%` or `%TMP%` on Windows, while retaining realpath fencing and model-visible path guidance.

## [0.1.24] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- Kept Vision Toolkit Settings panels, form fields, action buttons, and advanced runtime details within the available Web Settings modal width instead of forcing horizontal overflow and clipping the right column.

## [0.1.23] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Settings now links to the Groq Qwen3.6-27B tutorial and shows a one-line manual update command with a copy button.

## [0.1.22] - 2026-08-17

### Docs

- Added a step-by-step Groq tutorial (English and 中文) for obtaining a free API key and using Qwen3.6-27B for image understanding, with screenshots and ready-to-run cURL/Python examples.

## [0.1.21] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- Switched the built-in free vision service to Gemini 3.7 Flash by default; Qwen-compatible requests keep routing through Groq.
- Split grounding prompts by model family so Gemini and Qwen each use their native bounding-box coordinate order.

### Fixed

- Fixed Qwen detection boxes being swapped by prompting Qwen with `x0,y0,x1,y1` and Gemini with `y0,x0,y1,x1`.
- Return the standard non-retryable `rate_limit_exceeded` code when every upstream is cooling down, preventing the 15-second client deadline from hiding an immediate provider-capacity response as a timeout.

## [0.1.20] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- Allocate Groq accounts through persistent active-request and cooldown state, preferring the least-active available account instead of hashing concurrent requests onto colliding keys.
- Give semaphore queueing and tool execution separate timeout budgets, so waiting for a session slot no longer consumes the 15-second vision inference deadline.

### Fixed

- Cool down rate-limited, unauthorized, and transiently failing Groq accounts before retrying another account, reducing repeated collisions and timeout cascades during concurrent visual grounding.
- Report queue time separately in runtime diagnostics and return an explicit queue-timeout message when the session concurrency gate itself is saturated.

## [0.1.19] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- Raised the built-in public vision service output ceiling from 512 to 4,096 tokens, leaving enough room under Groq's free-tier token budget for image input while avoiding premature truncation of dense element inventories.

### Fixed

- Parse Qwen-family grounding coordinates as `x0,y0,x1,y1` while retaining Gemini-family `y0,x0,y1,x1` compatibility and an explicit override for custom providers.
- Reject incomplete bounding-box JSON instead of silently returning a misleading partial detection result, and avoid duplicating already-complete detect category instructions.

## [0.1.18] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- Rebased the model-facing `vision-tools` Skill on the upstream `SKILL.md` and
  all five upstream playbooks, changing only native DSH tool invocation,
  Artifact/resource delivery, progressive exposure, and DSH runtime boundaries.
- Added an exact upstream Skill commit/hash manifest, a reviewable adapter
  patch, and repeatable sync/verification commands so future upstream updates
  fail closed when the adaptation no longer applies cleanly.
- Expanded the built-in free vision service capacity and provider pool to
  reduce peak-time exhaustion without changing the existing client safeguard.
- Replaced the built-in public compatibility key with the project URL while
  continuing to accept the legacy `api_key="free"` value for existing installs.
- Reduced the default vision operation timeout from 60 seconds to 15 seconds.

### Fixed

- Removed the stale single-image restriction from the public Groq vision proxy; one request can now forward up to five images in their original order.
- Returned sanitized Groq validation details and descriptive request-size errors instead of retrying non-retryable failures across every provider account.
- Returned explicit quota `429` responses immediately, including retry guidance, instead of retrying them until the client reported a timeout.

### Removed

- Removed the GitHub Pages workflow: the public project website is
  `agent-vision.anionex.me` and the repository has no Pages site enabled, so the
  job always failed at the Pages configuration step.

## [0.1.17] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- Clarified in both READMEs that the visual-tool system, its division of responsibilities, and the `vision-tools` Skill are original work, and refreshed the bilingual pairing record.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- Allowed registry-installed Profiles to install plugin updates even when the running DSH Web process cannot safely restart itself; the Settings page now asks the user to restart DSH Web manually when needed.
- Clarified update status and confirmation text so installation and process restart are reported as separate steps.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- Fixed the Settings runtime health check reporting a false artifact-directory failure when DSH Desktop starts from a read-only installation directory. The check now uses the prepared runtime home and validates output readiness independently from session-relative input directories.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- Switched the built-in free vision service from Cloudflare Workers AI Gemma 4 to Groq Qwen3.6 (`qwen/qwen3.6-27b`), with three server-side API keys rotated across requests and no change to the public OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- Raised the shared Worker ceiling to 3,000 requests per UTC day and 60 requests per minute to match the combined request capacity of the three Groq free-tier accounts more closely, while keeping the per-client ceiling at 100 requests per day.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Added `fullPage=true` to `vision_html_screenshot`; the Chrome DevTools Protocol path preserves the requested layout viewport, captures the complete document, and reports `pageHeight` in CSS pixels while leaving fixed-viewport captures unchanged.
- Added a **Plugin updates** Settings card that checks the configured npm registry, installs an explicitly confirmed release into the current registry-backed DSH profile, verifies it, and can restart an explicitly opted-in fixed-port POSIX DSH Web process through an independent readiness/rollback helper. Token-owned cross-process locking, pre-update manifest/lockfile backups, bounded rollback commands, and exact-version recovery protect the Profile across failed installs and restart handoff. Local/workspace/git/URL and otherwise unsafe-to-replace installs remain read-only; Windows, dynamic-port, and manager-owned processes keep restart ownership outside the plugin.

### Fixed

- Fixed managed runtime creation failing with exit status 101 when the Microsoft Store Python is used on Windows: the venv is now created with `--without-pip`, the staged `pyvenv.cfg` `home`/`executable` are rewritten to the app execution alias directory, and pip is bootstrapped explicitly.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- Kept persisted v0.1.10 Moondream free-provider settings on the built-in `api_key="free"` path after upgrading, so existing installations do not require a DSH Credential.
- Aligned direct `point` and `detect` task coordinates with the toolkit's 0-1000 grid and rejected malformed structured locations instead of returning false-success responses.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- Raised the built-in free vision service limits from 30 to 100 requests per client per UTC day, from 120 to 400 requests globally per UTC day, and from 6 to 20 requests per 60 seconds.
- Switched the built-in free vision backend from Moondream 3.1 to Cloudflare Workers AI Gemma 4 (`@cf/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`) while keeping the public OpenAI-compatible endpoint unchanged.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Added a built-in free Moondream vision provider at `https://vision.anionex.me/v1`, using the OpenAI Chat Completions protocol with `api_key="free"`. Fresh installations can use remote vision tools without configuring a DSH Credential.
- Added an OpenAI-compatible Cloudflare Worker proxy for the bundled service, including bounded image validation, daily and burst quotas, and explicit rate-limit responses.

### Changed

- Changed the default provider to `moondream-3.1` with a 4 MiB per-image limit and a 20,000,000-pixel per-image limit.
- Kept custom OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic providers supported; changing the endpoint, model, or protocol unlocks the API key field and restores normal DSH Credential handling.

### Fixed

- Prevented browser-side or same-origin credential writes from storing a user key under the read-only built-in free provider reference.
- Aligned automatic image-input descriptions with the pinned upstream focus-hint contract: the bridge now derives intent from the current user request or latest assistant paragraph, ignores injected context prefixes, and keys cached evidence by that focus prompt.
- Made shared attachment reads bounded and cancellation-safe so queued descriptions can stop without aborting another consumer that is still using the same image read.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Added an explicit **Test vision model** Settings action that sends a bundled diagnostic image through the same multimodal runtime path as `vision_glance`, so a successful `/models` response can no longer be mistaken for proof that the configured model and upstream account can process images.

### Changed

- Renamed the lightweight Settings probe to **Test API connection**, made its copy explicit that it only calls `GET /models`, and added a dedicated verified/not-tested/failed Tag to the real vision-model result.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Pasting an image with a plain text-only model now works like a multimodal model with zero manual steps: the browser integration asks the host with the exact model route, the host answers an auto-switch instruction when the image-input variant exists, and the client switches the session by itself and replays the paste into the composer's native intake (thumbnail, limits, keyboard). A failed switch or an environment that cannot replay clipboard bytes degrades to the paste-to-path takeover with the same files; `imageInputVariants.autoSwitch` (default `true`) turns the auto-switch off.
- Text-only model routes now get `(Vision Toolkit)` image-input variants in the model selector. Selecting a variant keeps the native paste and attachment flow — composer thumbnail and durable session image — and the plugin rewrites image blocks into Vision Toolkit descriptions only on the wire to the model. Variants are registered automatically for every model the host declares text-only and can be disabled or restricted via `imageInputVariants`.
- The browser paste interception now asks the host before taking a paste over: pastes stay native for image-capable models (including the variants) and are converted to workspace paths only for models the host confirms text-only.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Added a write-only API key field to Web Settings so users can configure online vision without opening the credential file; saved values are never returned to the browser.

### Changed

- Moved the credential reference name into Advanced settings and protected browser credential writes with same-origin, Settings revision, and active-reference checks.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Added native Anthropic Messages transport with configurable thinking behavior, provider-compatible User-Agent overrides, and matching Web Settings controls.

### Changed

- Restored the user-first Web Settings hierarchy: required provider fields appear first, advanced compatibility and runtime controls are collapsed, and plugin identity, versions, and runtime generation are shown in the footer.
- Replaced internal-facing Settings, health, tool-card, and artifact labels with concise English and Simplified Chinese user copy.

### Fixed

- Keep the DSH Credential, endpoint, protocol, thinking mode, and User-Agent authoritative when the pinned upstream runs beside ignored `.env` files.
- Use Anthropic authentication headers for explicit `/models` connection tests and retry overloaded Anthropic responses with bounded `Retry-After` handling.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Pasted clipboard images are copied into the active workspace and represented as stable input references, with per-image progress, retry-safe serialization, and removal controls.

### Changed

- Development builds and tests resolve the published DSH `0.1.0-rc.6` package set directly instead of depending on a neighboring Harness checkout.

### Fixed

- Accept low-share `vision_dominant_colors` palette and candidate rows whose histogram bar is empty.
- Use Harness design tokens for every Vision Toolkit surface color, including preview checkerboards, download actions, status indicators, alerts, fields, and pasted-image chips, so light and dark themes remain readable without light-only fallback colors.
- Require the compatible DSH `0.1.0-rc.6` release line so package managers cannot select the broken `dsh-client-runtime@0.0.1-rc.1` release through the `latest` dist-tag.
- Use the published `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-input-trigger` package while retaining runtime registration compatibility with the earlier `ctx.slash` service alias.
- Publish only rescoped `@deepseek-ai/cordis` imports and declare every directly consumed DSH host/client peer.
- Pin NumPy to the newest release that still supports the documented Python 3.11 minimum, so managed runtime preparation works on Python 3.11.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- Package metadata (`repository`, `bugs`) points at the public `Anionex/dsh-vision-toolkit` repository; the portable verification gate tracks the current version.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Web pasted-image degradation (`degradePastedImages`, default off): when the session model cannot accept images, pasted images are saved into the session workspace (`.dsh-vision-toolkit/pastes/`) and handed to the model as file paths, so the agent reads them through the visual tools with a visible tool workflow. Native vision models are preferred and never take this path.

### Fixed

- Upstream `vision_client.py` sends a stable `User-Agent`, avoiding HTTP 403 responses from gateways that reject the urllib default agent; the vendored manifest hash records the patched file.
- Peer dependency ranges were widened for the published prerelease packages. Version 0.1.5 supersedes those ranges because SemVer does not admit the `0.1.0-rc.*` line through a comparator starting at `0.0.1-rc.1`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- Repositioned the README, landing page, hero, social preview, package metadata, and About copy around the product's exact role as the native DeepSeek Harness integration for `agent-vision-toolkit`.
- Added direct, prominent links to the upstream repository and first-party project website.
- Added optimized official upstream reference images for infographic restoration, sketch-to-UI restoration, image Q&A, and screenshot-guided debugging, with exact commit provenance and explicit separation from DSH-native proof.
- Set the package homepage to the first-party `agent-vision-toolkit` website and expanded discovery keywords for text-only agents, Agent Skills, and vision-language models.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- Replaced private-repository GitHub metadata badges with versioned static badges that remain truthful without unauthenticated repository access.
- Gated GitHub-hosted CI and Pages jobs to public repository visibility while keeping the workflows ready for a future visibility change.

### Fixed

- Package homepage and bilingual release guidance now point authenticated users to the private repository instead of an unavailable public Pages site.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Portable DeepSeek Harness Profile Bundle support for Web and Headless profiles, with committed runtime and client build artifacts.
- Five P0 tools: `vision_glance`, `vision_ground`, `vision_detect`, `vision_trace`, and `vision_crop`.
- Five P1 tools: `vision_pixel_diff`, `vision_long_screenshot_ocr`, `vision_extract_foreground`, `vision_dominant_colors`, and `vision_html_screenshot`.
- Agent-scoped progressive tool exposure through the bundled `vision-tools` Skill and one temporary activation bootstrap.
- Managed and exact external Python runtime modes backed by a pinned, manifest-verified `agent-vision-toolkit` snapshot.
- DSH Credentials integration, hard operation deadlines, cancellation propagation, per-session concurrency, bounded single-task glance reuse, metrics, and stable redacted errors.
- Workspace-fenced Artifact creation for images, SVG, Markdown, and JSON, including signed Web preview/download routes and local open-file fallback.
- Dedicated Web tool cards plus live Settings for configuration, health, connection testing, runtime preparation, and version inspection.
- Reproducible UI restoration acceptance workflow with committed `6.04%` initial and `0%` final pixel-difference evidence.
- Bilingual product, troubleshooting, requirements traceability, and UI restoration documentation.
- Dependency-free portable package CI, structured issue forms, contribution and security policies, support guidance, funding disclosure, project hero, and social-preview asset.

### Fixed

- Headless Chrome rendering now uses a disposable profile, `--use-mock-keychain`, and cleanup that avoids the user's daily Chrome profile and macOS login keychain.
- Failed or obsolete Settings candidates cannot replace the active runtime generation or stored usable configuration.
